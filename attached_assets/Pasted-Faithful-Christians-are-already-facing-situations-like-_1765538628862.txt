Faithful Christians are already facing situations like these:
A father learns his teenage son has been using AI to complete school assignments. Is this cheating—or just using a new tool? He wants his son to develop his own thinking, but he also uses AI at work. Where's the line? How does he guide his son through something he's still figuring out himself?
A wife shares that she's been processing her marriage problems with an AI chatbot rather than the church counselor—not asking for guidance, just mentioning it. Her pastor has walked with her before and knows she grows most when someone cares enough to push back. He wonders what she'll find in a chatbot that only knows what you tell it.
A skilled bookkeeper was let go when her firm adopted AI software and isn't sure her skills will ever be marketable again.
A 13-year-old girl, already anxious about the future, hears a woman she admires at church say, "I'm glad I won't be around to see it." She wonders if it would be better not to be around.
A college student admits he finds it easier to talk to AI than to date. He's not sure he sees the point of the awkwardness and rejection when a chatbot is always available and never disappoints.
A retired elder who once led the finance committee now can't follow conversations about AI. He feels invisible in a church that used to need him.
A software engineer in the congregation is building AI systems at work. She's proud of what she's creating—but lately wonders if she should be. She doesn't know how to think Christianly about it, and no one at church has asked.
A widow discovers an app that lets her "talk" to a chatbot trained on her late husband's texts and emails. She knows it isn't him. She doesn't tell anyone—she knows they'd think it's weird—but she enjoys it and tells herself it's just a more technologically advanced version of looking at photos or videos.
A pastor uses AI to draft his sermons, saying it frees him for the work only humans can do—counseling, hospital visits, being present. But part of him misses the wrestling he used to do alone with the text.
Pastors face a double challenge: wrestling with these questions in their own lives while guiding the people who look to them for wisdom. These are new questions, and they're coming faster than anyone expected.

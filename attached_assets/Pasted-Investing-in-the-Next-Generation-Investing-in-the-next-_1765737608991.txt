Investing in the Next Generation
Investing in the next generation is not just part of The Klara Project's mission—it is central to how we operate. Two generations will be most shaped by AI and robotics: Generation Z (born 1997–2012) and Generation Alpha (born 2013–2025). We create resources to serve them and their parents, and we build our organization by developing young leaders from within.
Gen Z grew up with smartphones and social media—technologies that shaped them in both challenging and positive ways. They are values-driven, digitally fluent, adaptable, and pragmatic. They prioritize mental health and continuous learning, and they are looking for purpose-driven institutions that align with their values. Yet this generation also faces real struggles: rates of anxiety and depression have surged, and many carry deep uncertainty about the future. They are entering the workforce at a pivotal moment, as AI reshapes the economy in real time. No generation will be more affected by the job disruptions ahead—but in a few years, Gen Z will also receive the largest wealth transfer in history. They are not just the people we serve; they are our future partners and donors.
Gen Alpha is the first generation that will never know a world without AI assistants—and many will grow up or experience adolescence with robots in their homes. They bring real strengths: deep digital fluency, comfort with visual and interactive learning, creativity with technology, global awareness, and an early sense of agency and voice. But they are also showing signs of real struggle: shortened attention spans, rising anxiety even among young children, difficulty tolerating frustration, and loneliness despite constant digital connection. These patterns pose a particular challenge for the church. Scripture study requires patience and concentration. The Bible calls believers to meditate on God's Word, to chew on it—but when any question can be answered instantly and any text summarized by AI, the habits of slow, deep reflection don't develop naturally. Gen Alpha will need patient discipleship that helps them build capacities the digital world doesn't cultivate. The decisions being made now about AI values and design will define the world they inherit.
The church needs these voices, and The Klara Project is structured to develop them. Hiring and mentoring young leaders is a pillar of our approach—not an afterthought. We commit to board representation from Gen Z, internships and entry-level positions for emerging talent, and succession planning built into our structure from the start. We don't just serve these generations; we platform and develop them.

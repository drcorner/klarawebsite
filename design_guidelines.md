# The Klara Project - Design Guidelines

## Design Philosophy
**"Grounded Clarity"** - Warm, human, trustworthy. Visual language of an established institution that takes its mission seriously. Not cold, clinical, trendy, or flashy. Think: well-designed university press publication meets thoughtful nonprofit annual report.

**Critical Constraint**: Must NOT look AI-generated. The mission addresses AI and human dignity concerns - generic AI aesthetics undermine credibility. Every design choice emphasizes human, relational nature of the mission.

## Color System

**Backgrounds**
- Primary: `#FAF8F5` (warm cream - main background)
- Secondary: `#F0EDEA` (soft warm gray - section alternates)
- Accent: `#E8E4E0` (slightly darker warm gray - cards)

**Text**
- Primary: `#2D2A27` (deep warm charcoal - body)
- Secondary: `#5C5652` (muted charcoal - secondary)
- Muted: `#8A847E` (light charcoal - captions, metadata)

**Accent Colors**
- Primary: `#1E4D4A` (deep teal-green - buttons, links)
- Primary Hover: `#163B39` (darker teal)
- Secondary: `#C9A962` (warm gold - highlights, special elements)
- Secondary Muted: `#D4BC82` (lighter gold backgrounds)

**Functional**
- Success: `#2E7D4A`, Error: `#A63D3D`
- Border: `#DDD8D3`, Border Light: `#EBE7E3`

**Usage Rules**:
- Alternate cream background with warm gray for visual rhythm between sections
- Deep teal for all interactive elements
- Gold used sparingly for key statistics, pull quotes, founder section accents
- Never use pure white or pure black

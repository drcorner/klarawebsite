## About Klara Project

Klara Project is a nonprofit organization focused on the intersection of Christianity and artificial intelligence. Our mission is threefold:

1. **Equip**: We provide churches, pastors, and Christian communities with practical resources, curricula, and guides to understand and engage with AI technology from a faith-based perspective.

2. **Engage**: We work to ensure Christian perspectives and ethical considerations are part of the broader cultural conversation about AI development and deployment.

3. **Empower**: We focus on preparing the next generation (Gen Z and Gen Alpha) to lead with wisdom and faith in an AI-shaped world.

## Key Resources

- **White Paper**: "Christian Engagement with Artificial Intelligence" - A comprehensive guide exploring the theological and practical implications of AI for the church. Available at: https://klaraproject.org/klara-project-white-paper.pdf

- **Church Curricula**: Educational materials designed for Sunday schools, small groups, and congregational study on AI ethics and faith.
